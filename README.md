<b>Hello everyone! Hope you all are doing good.</b>

# Housing Prices Prediction Project:

<b>Project idea – This Project focuses on the dataset which has house prices of the Boston residual areas. The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. Hence, creating a ML Model along with appropriate plots and results which involves accuracy of the model as well. Hope you like it.</b>.

# Fake News Detection Project:

<b>Project idea – Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.
You can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. Hence, created a ML model which will not only just work on this dataset but also on any datasets henceforth which can classify fake & real news.</b>

I got to have hands-on experience on:

<li>Diff. Seaborn Plots
<li>NLP
<li>Vectorization
