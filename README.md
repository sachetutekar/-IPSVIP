<b>Hello everyone! Hope you all are doing good.</b>

# Housing Prices Prediction Project:

<b>Project idea – This Project focuses on the dataset which has house prices of the Boston residual areas. The expense of the house varies according to various factors like crime rate, number of rooms, etc. Hence, creating a ML Model along with appropriate plots and results which involves accuracy of the model as well. Hope you like it.</b>.

# Fake News Detection Project:

<b>Project idea – Fake news spreads like a wildfire and this is a big issue in this era.
You can learn how to distinguish fake news from a real one. Hence, created a ML model which will not only just work on this dataset but also on any datasets henceforth which can classify fake & real news. Hope you like it.</b>

# Iris Flowers Classification Project:

<b>Project idea – The iris flowers have different species and you can distinguish them based on the length of petals and sepals.
This is a basic project for machine learning beginners to predict the species of a new iris flower. Hope you like it.</b>

# Loan Prediction using Machine Learning Project:

<b>Project idea – The idea behind this ML project is to build a model that will classify how much loan the user can take. It is based on the user’s marital status, education, number of dependents, and employments. You can build a linear model for this project. Hope you like it.</b>
